Phishing emails are a significant cybersecurity threat that can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. 
The MailShield project goal is to help users quickly identify phishing emails by analyzing both the content and email headers. 
Specifically, the tool will enhance security awareness and reduce risk of email-based attacks by providing a clear classification of emails as “safe” or “Phishing”. 
The project’s goals are to improve cybersecurity awareness and prevention through a user-friendly interface.
